# LifeSimulator
In 2016 I started to learn to code almost entirely by reading through the python docs.
Since I only read the docs, I didn't really learn much about good practices, nor how to code properly.
As of writing this program has no functions; and the same code can be found in many places.

The git repo was created locally in 2018 along with some changes to make it work on Linux.
Other than that nothing was changed since 2016 until now.

If you would like to contribute, go right ahead and clone the project, make a change, and make a pull request.
